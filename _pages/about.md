Hello there! I am a theorerical physicist fascinated by the Universe on every scale, trying to understand the origins of large-scale structures and of their magnetic fields, the nature of dark energy, and the role of quantum effects in the very early Universe.


I am an editor of the Open Journal of Astrophysics!

2024 has been full of good surprises! I am now part of the editorial board of the Open Journal of Astrophysics! I have been wanting to contribute to open science more actively for some time, and now I finally can. Why is it so important? Well, because OJA is a diamond open-access journal, meaning there is no fees to publish a manuscript, no fees to access it. That changes from wicked publishers bleeding dry research institutions with their astronomical publishing fees, right? 

Start of my second postdoc!

I just started a new postdoc position at the University of Western Ontario! After the last three years in Finland, I continue doing exciting research in a nordic environment. What's the theme this time? Well, I will keep developing tools to understand the very early Universe, but this time in a context new to me! As part of Francesca Vidotto's group, bouncing cosmology in the context of Loop Quantum Cosmology is going to be the centre of my attention. A couple of new projects initiated with Francesca involve gravitational waves, parity violation, and connections with observations! And all of that topped with excellent feline company. I couldn't ask for more, right?

{% comment %}About my academic background
======

In 2009, I realise astrophysics is what makes me vibe and decide to enroll in the physics course of the nearest university (Lille 1). I learn about the different academic career paths and, after a conversation with the instructor of my statistical physics course, I apply to enroll to the Paris Observatory (Paris-Meudon, in fact, they insist about it!), and go there to attend an. I successfully pass the interview to my big surprise, which remains one of the

A reminder to myself about how I got interested into cosmology
======

I come from a small village in the North of France in which the number of inhabitants is less than the number of cows. A very small, outlaying village, in which contact with nature is perpetual. The days were full of animals to discover, the nights full of bright stars. My dad was the first person to talk to me about stars. About how they form, how they die, how what we see in the sky might already be gone... He was always so proud when he talked about Einstein's theory of relativity! He was no expert, but he always felt such a strong fascination about what nature has to offer. His fascination for the world was a gift he passed on to me. He and my mom always gave me their support, which helped me overcome the many barriers I encountered until I became the first academic of the family. I know you are proud of me, mom, dad, but I am so much more proud of you both. I love you very dearly, mom. I miss you so much, dad. Thank you both for everything.

{% comment %} Learning was always so much fun as a child. I believe I was excelling in elementary school because of that.

I hated middle school and high school. Physics was the most boring course I had then, and this from the first lesson in middle school until I entered my last year of high school. In fact, my grades in all science courses were disastrous. Incidentally, when I was 15, I got internet at home, which was the time I started to learn about physics on my own. It was such a cool breeze to spend countless hours reading about cosmology, particle physics, string theory on Wikipedia. My last year of high school was another step towards <i>thinking</i> about physics as a career path. During that year, I was lucky enough to have the best physics teacher since I had started school, Mr. Assal. Serious, funny, and kind at the same time. He cared about explaining physics to the students without ever blaming whoever had low grades. He abhorred laziness though, and kept pushing the students out of their comfort zone. His compassion, his empathy, and his efforts to make people understand were essential in motivating me when I was at my lowest. I will always be grateful for that.
